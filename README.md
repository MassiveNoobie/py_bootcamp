# py_bootcamp - python bootcamp for beginners - using jupyter notebook
A beginners python bootcamp in Jupyter Notebook Python Notes focused on basic training ramping up towards AI/ML in future. 


Jupyter Notebook; documented python basics

In a bootcamp style, it's a nonstop flow of new information that works together from top to bottom.

Feel free to help me with documentation to improve the python bootcamp training funnel for other non-technical python engineers.

I created https://canopys.io to help others execute python and I hope this code here is a way for others to kick start their canopys automation adventures.

Interested in following along on your computer? Learning python beginnger pieces is difficult without typing all of the code yourself, however you can use this as a place to quickly ctrl+f find information as you're grinding through another bootcamp too.

Consider installing; anaconda distribution https://dev3lop.com/setup-anaconda3-a-data-science-toolkit/
