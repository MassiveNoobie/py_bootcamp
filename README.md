Jupyter Notebook Python Notes focused on basic training ramping up towards AI/ML in future.


Jupyter Notebook; documented python basics

In a bootcamp style, it's a nonstop flow of new information that works together from top to bottom.

Feel free to help me with documentation to improve the python bootcamp training funnel for other non-technical python engineers.

I created https://canopys.io to help others execute python and I hope this code here is a way for others to kick start their canopys automation adventures.
